# tictactoe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game in JavaScript (vanilla).  Also a first attempt at separation of concerns in a 
ground-up build.

First production contains no AI and computer moves are random.  I would like to revisit this at a later time and implement 
some leveling and game theory AI.

Project for FreeCodeCamp Front End Dev certificate.
